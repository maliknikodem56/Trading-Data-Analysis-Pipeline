Trading Data Analysis Pipeline

This is a beginner project made in Python and SQL aiming to help me with my trading data analysis.
My goal was to find an easier way to collect, store and model my trading performance.
This projects consists of following steps:
1. Trading data input as an object.
2. Trading data pushed into a connected SQL base.
3. The data is pulled from the SQL data base into a python file.
4. The data is cleaned, visualized and automatically analyzed trough descriptive statistics with statistical tests.
5. The functions return a result and automatic interpretation.
6. The data is used to generate a PDF file that includes a report of trading performance.

The project includes following files:
config.py,
demotradingclass.py,
demotrading1.py,
demtrading1_analysis,
generate_report.py,
analysis_report.pdf
